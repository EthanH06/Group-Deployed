# Accomplishments

         - Helped debug while Brandon completed the backend for our passion project
                    
         - Completed the homework hacks and popcorn hacks for the student teachings this week
          
         - Finished our student teaching lesson
          
         - Created a mood detector
# Issues:

         - The api (chat.py) was not defined in main.py so but Brandon fixed this by properly defining it (chat_api = Blueprint(‘chat_api’, name, url_prefix=’/api/chats’) api = Api(chat_api))
         
         - The model wasn't working properly so I remade it
