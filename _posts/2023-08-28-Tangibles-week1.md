# I was able to achieve the following:

      - Adding an image to my website
      
      - Writing things in my blog

      - make my own website (apart from my local host)

      - Started learning some basic python

# Problems I solved

      - My old server was full. I was able to access my server because I asked Mr. Mortensen for a new one.
      
      - I wasn't able to upload the image. I was able to add the image by uploading into my emulator.
