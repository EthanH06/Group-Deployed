# Things I learned

     - I learned some very basic python coding (print, if else)
     - I also learned some basic html from adding games that used html into my website and making a table
     - I learned how to keep a lab notebook (I've never done that before)
     - I learned about hex color codes

# Problems and Solutions
Problem 1:

     - I wasn't able to add anything to my notebook after I added one game

Solution 1:

     - I copied the page for the snake game, pasted it and then started to make changes to add other things

Problem 2:

     - I accidentaly put all my files from the new github repository into the old one

Solution 2:

     - I was able to go to the dowloads file in the ubuntu emulator and add the files to my new github repository
