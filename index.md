## Ninaad's Blog

I'm Ninaad, a nighthawk coder. I'm a current Junior at Del Norte and my biggest passion is business. My dream future would be to start a tech company after college and become an entreprenuer. I'm in the Robotics Club, DECA, I founded the Clean Water Crew, and I love filming videos for ASB. Go to my [Github account](https://github.com/NinaadDarugar) !!
